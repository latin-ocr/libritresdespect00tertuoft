scilicet ob Dei offensam utrobique. Immo tu colis,
qui facis, ut coli possint. Colis autem4 non spiritu
vilissimi nidoris alicujus, sed tui proprio, nec anima
pecudis impensa, sed anima tua. Illis ingenium
tuum immolas, illis sudorem tuum libas, illis pru·
dentiam tuam accendis. Plus es illis quam sacerdos,
cum per te habeant sacerdotem3 diligentia tua*
numen iHorum est. Negas te quod facis colere?
Sed illi non negant, quibus hanc saginatiorem et
auratiorem et maj orem⁶ hostiam caedis, salutem tuam.

Tota die ad hanc partem zelus fidei perorabit
ingemens Christianum ab idolis in ecclesiam ¹ venire,
de adversaria officina in domum Dei venire, attollere

⁴ eolis autem. Observe the sa-
crIficial terms nidor, anima pecudis,
immolas, libas, accendis, saqz‘natus,
auratus, major, hostiam caedere.

⁵ diliqentia tua. Both Dodgson
and Neander (Antignost. Ρ. 228)
translate diliqentia as if it were
nomin. It is no doubt abl. ‘By
your industry their divinity exists.'

⁶ auratiorem et maiorem. The
horns of victims were gilded. The
bull or cow was called major hostia,
opposed to minor hostia, as the
sheep, the goat, &0-

Ch. VII. ¹ ecclesiam. See De
Spect. c. 25, n. 3. Pamelius and La
Cerda on this passage have collected
thirty-three different names which
the buildings set apart for divine
service bore. Their object was to
prove the existence of peculiar build-
ings for worship at a very early age.
In the names which they bring for-
ward, promiscuously‚ we observo
various classes: 1 referring to the
congregation, as ecclesia, conventi-
cula5 2 to the sacred character of
nie place, as domus Dei, dominicum,

sacellum ; 3 to the purpose of meet-
ing, as oratorium, εὐκτήριον, pro-
seucha ; 4 to the places where they
met under persecution, as mar-ty?
rium, confessio, coemeterz‘um, cente,-
5 to buildings afterwards given them,
as basilica, templum. The earlier
names imply no more than stated
places of meeting, which need not
have been permanently secui-ed for
that purpose. Indeed, there could
scarcely have been more so long as
Christianity was at best tolerated.
Another class of names refers us to
the secret recesses of the catacombs,
whither the Christians fied to eele-
brate in safety their common wor-
ship. The terms basilica and tem-
plum remind us how Constantine
gave up basilica (judgment-halls)
to the christiam, and how the Chris-
tian displaced heathen worship, and
often occupied heathen sanctuarios.
Tertul. contrasts the ChrIstian place
of worship with pagan splendour,

apertis et ad lucem. Amat fiquroe‘
