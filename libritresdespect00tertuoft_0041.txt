THE VIEWS OF TERTULLIAN. xxxvii

tem, but at last found himself carried beyond it, and
then began, as so many have since done, to attack those
whom he had left as perverters of the genuine spirit of
Christianity. In determining the order in which the
three treatises now before us appeared, we were partly
guided by internal marks, and must not therefore now
assume the order, and thence draw positive conclusions.
But we may go so far as to point out how well the
proposed order falls in with the known history of Ter-
tullian, and the probable course by which such a person
would pass over to such a sect as that of Montanus; and
it may not be irrelevant to remark, that the very choice
of his subjects is suggestive of some such progress. He
first denounces the shows, where he seems to have reason
and authority evidently on his side, then trades and pro-
fessione and customs, where there is room for doubt ; and
lastly, an usage which though undoubtedly mixed up
with idolatry, was in itself harmless and indifferent.

1 do not, however, propose to dwell minutely upon the
indications of Montanism or of a Montanistic tendency
in the several treatises. Some of them will be brought
forward in the course of the following remarks upon
some of the special arguments employed by Tertullian
on the subjects here taken in hand.
