numerous, Ι have felt somewhat more confidence in
adopting this principle. For instance, in the opening
sentences the Codex Agobardi has a reading evidently
belonging to a different recension from that of the
reading of Pamelius. ‘As I find that the other ancient
editions and the MSS. which are known, including the
Cod. Magliabechianus, agree with Pamelius, Ι have
followed Pamelius, the two readings being equally in-
telligible.

The principal purpose which this edition of three
Treatises of Tertullian is meant to serve, is that of
rendering this portion of a very difficule author intelli«
gible to readers not familiar with his style. Niebuhr
denies that there are any provincialisms to be found in
African Latinity, and asserts that its peculiarity consists
merely in the introduction of ancient phrases from the
earlier Latin writers17. And, as in early writers, like
Lucretius, and in those who recurred to archaic phrase-
ology, like Tacitus, we find constructions upon a Greek
model, there is often a doubt whether particular expres-
sions in Tertullian are to be set down to his imitation
of early writers, or to his familiarity with the Greek
language. It is remarkable that in the case of the
other writer, who especially represents the African style
(Apuleius), Greek was the language of his youth, and
Latin was acquired afterwards by study18, and Tertullian
certainly wrote in Greek as well as Latium.

Independently however of any peculiarity of this
kind, Tertullian's writings are frequently obscure, not so
much on account of his language as of his mode of
thought20. And in order to facilitate the study of his
works it is quite as necessary to explain his arguments
as to illustrate his Latinity. I have endeavoured to do
