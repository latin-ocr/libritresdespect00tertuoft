'xlii ' INTRODUOTION.

bidden by the Apost-le (1 Tim. vi. 43 Tit. iii. 10); an
argument, it will be observed, itself based upon Serip-
ture3 and secondly, because heretics do not adopt the
same canon, or the same principle of interpretation as
the orthodOX.

To settle the preliminary question, Where is the true
canon, and the true principle of interpretation? we
must consider the source from whence it is derived. If
we find, on the one hand, a number of Churches, which
can trace up the succession of their ministers to the
Apostles themselves, agreeing and holding what‘they do
hold as a legacy bequeathed to them by their prede-
cessors, and on the other, a body of men bringing for-
ward some new principle, the result of their own cogita-
tions, we may determine, according to Tertullian, that
the truth lies with the former 1⁶. The nearer the apo-
stolic times were, the more forcible was this argument,
the greater the probability that the judgment of the
Apostle was preserved. And hence the great value of
the suceessionw, (the traditio apostolica, upon which
1renaeus¹8 insists so frequently), because it might fairly
be supposed that in a Church where the rule had passed
in an unbroken line the truth would be preserved.

Further than this, the agreement of all such Churches
in one belief was, in Tertullian's mind, a strong presump-
tion in favour of their conclusions ; nor shall we, I think,
be inclined to hesitate in adopting his rule, which was an
anticipation of the famous one of Vincentius of Lerins,¹
