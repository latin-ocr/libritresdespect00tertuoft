CAP.X. Ipsam primam novi discipuli stipem² Minervae et

honori et nomini consecrat, ut etsi non profanatus
alicui idolo verbotenus de idolothyto esse dicatur,

[pro idololatra vitetur] ³.

Quid minus est inquina-

menti eo quod4 praestat quaestus et nominibus et

honoribus idolo nuncupatus?

Tam⁵ Minervalia

Minervas, quam Saturnalia Saturni, quae⁶ etiam ser-
viculis sub tempore Saturnalium celebrari necesse

est.

Etiam strenae⁷ captandae et septimontium et

brumae et carae cognationis honoraria⁸ exigenda
omnia, flore scholae coronandae3 flaminicae et aediles

sacrificant, creatis schola honoratur feriis.

Idem

fit idoli natali; omnis diaboli pompa frequentatur.
Quis haec competere Christiano existimabit, nisi

Nec vos, turba,feri, censu fraudata,
maqistri, Spernite, discipulos attra-
het illa novos. Frequentabit does not
imply actual attendance at the fes-
tival, but is equivalent to our word
‘ celebrate-⁹

² primam...stipem. This payment
was called Minerval. The master
did not actually dedicate it, but re-
ceiving it in the name and in honour
of Minerva, recognized it as sacred
to a heathen goddess.

³ pro idololatra vitetur. eod.
Ag. pro idololatria vitatur. Gel.
and Pam. pro idolatra vitetur. Rig.
omits the words, and Ι have en-
closed them in a bracket. 1f we re-
tain them, as Oehler does, we must
translate thus, ‘so that although he
be not said, as far as mere words
g0, to eat of what is offered to
idols, having been bound over to
the unholy service of any idol, he
should be avoided-as an idolater’...
Omitting the words in the brackets,
‘so that although not bound over
to the unholy service of any idol, as

far as words gc, he may be said to
eat of what is offered to idols,¹ i.e.
in receiving support from an idola-
trous payment. Dodgson, who fol-
lows Rigalt's reading, connects ver·
botenus with dicatur.

⁴ eo quod. Cod. Ag. and Gangn.
eo quem. Gel. quod, omiss. eo. Pam.
and Rig. eo quod. Oehl. by eonjee.
eo, quam, explaining eo, ‘scil. quod
non profanatus alicui idolo verbote-
nus de idolothyto esse dicatur: The
sentence is ironicalz ⁶ what less pol-
lution is there than that which is
produced by a payment dedicated to
an idol, both in name and honour.’

⁵ Tam. Cod. Ag„ Gangn. and
Rig. quam. So also Oehl. who con-
siders quam...quam to be used for
tam...quam. See above, c. 4. But
the instances there quoted differ
from this, where the former sentence
is the antecedent, and distinct from
the relative sentence that follows:
‘ The Minervalia are as much sacred
to Minerva, as the Saturnalia >to
Satura-⁸
