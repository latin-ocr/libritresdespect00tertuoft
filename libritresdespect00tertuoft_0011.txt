was the Fuldensian‚ and that this was a MS. of a family
distinet from all the common MSS. of these treatises.

The Pamelian Editions were repeated at Geneva, at
Paris, at Franeker‚ at Heidelberg, at Cologne, in various
forme, up to 1617, the date of the Cologne Edition.

LA CERDA published at Paris, 1624—30‚ two volumes
of an Edition which was never completed. He gives no
information as to the principle upon which he formed his
text, but he appears, as far as I can judge from examining
the treatises here published, to have taken Pamelius'
text, and introduced such emendations from the con-
Jectures of himself and others, as seemed to him neces-
sary for the explanation of the author. In many cases
he has professedly altered the text on mere conjecture.
His object was especially to illustrate and explain. La
Cerda made use of the Editions of Rhenanus, Pamelius,
and Junius ; and his notes contain most of their informa-
tion enriched with copious illustratione, both from clas-
sioal and ecclesiastical writers. The whole of the text is
broken up into paragraphs, and to each paragraph is
annexed (distinct from the notes) a paraphrase, wherein
every difficulty is either explained or attempted to be
explained. This Edition has been much used by Oehler
and other Editors.

In 1625 the two Books Ad Nationes were first pub-
lished at Geneva, by James Gothofred, from the Codex
Δροόανᾱί, a MS. of the 9th Century. The MS. the
Editor presented to the Royal Library at Paris, where it
is still preserved. The MS. is imperfect, but contains,

among other treatises‚ the treatises De Spectaculis, De
Idololatria, and De Corona.

Spectaculis or De Idololatria. The Pudicitia, together with Novatian‘s
eod. Clementis contained 1, De De Trinitate. Pamelius also used a
Spectaculis3 2, De Praescriptionibus MS. (of the eleventh century) of the
Haereticorum; 3, De Resurrectione Apologeticus only, called the Cod.
Cerni83 4, De Monogamia3 5, De Puteanus, now in the Royal Library
Jejunio adversus Psychicos3 6, De at Paris.
