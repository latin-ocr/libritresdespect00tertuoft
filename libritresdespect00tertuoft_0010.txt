(de la Barre), who seems to have made use of the Editions
of Rhenanus and Gelenius, but has not distinguished
whence he has taken either readings or notes. On com-
paring this Edition with others, I find that the readings
usually agree with Gelenius, and it does not appear that
he knew of the Edition of Pamelius.

II. PAMEmus rendered. most important services to
the text os Tertullian. His first Edition of his works was
published at Antwerp, 1579. He employed especially
three MSS. from the Vatican, two from Belgium, and one
from England, (all of uncertain datell). He revised the
text, and introduced many alterations, some from MSS„
but some, as his notes tellus, from conjectures of himself
and others. He added some poetical works and frag-
ments in Latin and Greek, not before edited; and divided
the treatises into their present chapters. He prefixed a
life of Tertullian, and Paradoxa Tertulliani cum Antidotis
Pamelit'.

The text of this Edition seems to have been preserved
in the Editions of Paris, 1583; Antwerp, 15843 Paris, 1585.

In 1587, Junius published at Franeker an edition,
adding his own notes to those of Pamelius, but scru-
pulously retaining the text of Pamelius.

The most yaluable contribution which J unius made to
the text of Tertullian was the collation of the MS. Fulden-
sis (now lost), containing the Apoloyeticus and Adversus
Judaeos. This collation had been made by Franciscus
Modius of Bruges, and was given to Junius by Gasper
Schoppius. Junius considered that more than one MS.
