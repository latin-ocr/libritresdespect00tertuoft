CAP. lv. reperio, sequitur ut traditio consuetudini morem
hunc dederit, habiturum quandoque apostoli auc-
toritatem ex interpretatione rationis ⁴. His igitur
exemplis renuntiatum erit, posse etiam non scrip-
tam traditionem in observatione defendi, confir-
matam consuetudine, idonea teste probatae tunc
traditionis ex perseverantia observationis⁵. Con-
suetudo autem etiam in civilibus rebus pro lege
suscipitur, cum deficit lex, nec differt Scriptura an
ratione consistat, quando et legem ratio commen-
det. Porro si ratione lex constat, lex erit omne
jam quod ratione constiterit a quocumque produc-
tumss. An non putas omni fideli licere concipere
et constituere, duntaxat quod Deo congruat, quod
disciplinae conducat, quod saluti proficiat, dicente
Domino, Cur autem non et a vobis ipsis quod jus·

omni sententia rerum examinandarum dicit et

been grounded. Tertull. refers to
the argument of S. Paul in 1 Cor.
xi· 3-15,

⁶ confirmatam consuetudine. An
unwritten tradition may find its de-
fence in the very fact of its observ-
ance, seeing that it has been con-
firmed by usage, which is a compe-
tent witness that the tradition has
by that time been sanctioned by con-

tinued'observance. Tune, at the time
of its having passed into a custom.

⁶ si ratione... Even a law owes
its obligation to the fact that it
is the enunciation of a principle.
Therefore any maxim which rests
upon a principle, whoever may have
laid it down, will have the force of

⁷ sed et ipse. These words are
omitted by Oehler, on the ground
that the lacuna in the Cod. Ag. is
