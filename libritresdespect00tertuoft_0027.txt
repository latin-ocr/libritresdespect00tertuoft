THE STATE oF HEATHEN SOCIETY. xxiii

senting actions of all kinds by gestures of their body.
But the actions¹¹ were commonly such as involved the
grossest indecency, and the wantonness and immodesty
of these pantomimists was the constant subject of com-
plaint with the graver sort of the heathens themselves ¹².
Such were the theatrical exhibitions of Imperial Rome,
varied by rope-dancing and such posture-work‚ and dis-
graced yet more by the grossest of all exhibitions--the
public exposure of naked women at the Floral games.

Besides these amusements, which had originated
under the Republic, the Emperors encouraged games
aster the Greek fashion ¹³. The introduction of athletes
was indeed earlier than this. But Nero took the most
decided steps to bring in the Greek form of contests‚
and was censured by some who regarded these foreign
amusements as indicative of degeneraeyu, But the
fashion grew, and in the vast Thermae built by successive
emperors, the Stadium and Palaestra always had their
place. We shall be little inclined to consider these
amusements as degenerate in comparison with those of
the circus, theatre, and amphitheatre. But their intro-
duetion was a mark of the entire abandonment of the
populace of Rome to pleasure, and helped to make
the life of the citizens a life of idle enjoyment and
dissipation.

The vicious excitement, the barbarity and the im-
purity connected with all these entertainments, might
well make them odious to those who had embraced the
precepts of the Gospel.

But there was yet another reason for their unlawful-
