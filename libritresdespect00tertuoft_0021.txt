THE DATE OF THE THREE TREATISES. ‘xvii

tria seems so closely connected with the De Spectaculis,
that we are naturally disposed to place it immediately
after the De Spectaculis. In this we are confirmed by
the more decided tone of Montanism in the De Corona,
which marks a somewhat later period in Tertullian's life.
-And the brief notice of military service in the De Idolo·-
Ζαιφία2 would scarcely have been unaccompanied by a.
reference to the fuller discussion of the same subject in
the Dc Gorona⁸‚ had that treatise then been in existence.

If then we can ascertain the probable date of the De
Corona, we may, by taking a few steps backward, ap-
proach nearly to the dates of the other two treatises.
We are not without means of ascertaining this. The
first Chapter proves,

1 That it was written at a time at which there
was more than one Emperor (praestantissimorum Impera-
torum);

2 That the Christians had been long enjoying im-
munity from severe persecution3

3 That a donat-ive had just been given to the
soldiers.

1 Although at the commencement of Severus'
reign, in 193, he half recognized the authority of his
rival Pescennius Niger, and allowed to Albinus the dig-
nity of Caesar, so that some have supposed proesentis
imperii triplex virtus in the De Ραῐῑὶο4 to refer to the
threefold authority of Severus, Niger, and Albinus, still
it is certain that their armies never acted in concert,
and Severus proceeded to destroy his rivals one after
the other. Niger was defeated and slain in 196, Albi-
nus in 197, and Caracalla was associated in the empire
with his father Severus in 198. The De Corona then
must have been written in or after 198.
