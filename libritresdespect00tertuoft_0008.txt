iv INTRODUGTION.

scribes these MSS. as so similar as to be plainly derived
from the same source. The value of this Edition is
greatly enhanced by the scrupulous fidelity with which
Rhenanus professes to have transcribed from the Mss.⁴:
particularly as Rhenanus considered the state of the
text hopeless, and almost abandoned the task of editing
it in despair ⁵. This Edition did not contain several
treatises which have since appeared as part of Tertul-

lian’s Works. Among these are the books De Specta·
culis and De Idololatria. So that the De Corona Militat

is the only one of the three, here published, which is
found in the first Basle Edition. Rhenanus added a few
notes, and affixed Definitiones Ecclesiasticorum Doymatum,
as an antidote to any heterodox opinion of Tertullian.
There were reprints of this edition in 1525, 1528⁶‚ 1536.

In the year 1539, Rhenanus, with the assistance of
Gmmmus, published a second Edition of Tertullian at
Basle. The same works of Tei-tullian are in this as in
the former Edition; but Rhenanus, who begins to take
heart as to his task‚ seems to have given up the scru-
pulous fidelity he professes in the former Edition. He

that the Apologeticus was probably
reprinted from an earlier Italian
edition. The Aldine text of the
Apologeticus (1515) agrees aceu-
rately with that of Rhenanus.

what altered from conjecture, but
Rhenanus had then no fresh Mss.

⁷ This MS„ which is not known
to exist now, Oehler considers to
have been more accurate than those
which Rhenanus had hitherto used,
but to have been of the same family.
