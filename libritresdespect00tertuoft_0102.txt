Taceo de illo, qui hominem leoni prae se opponit,
ne parum sit homicida quam qui eundem postmo-
dum jugulaffl.

Quot adhuc perorabimus modis nihil ex his,
quae-'¹v spectaculis deputantur, placitum Deo esse,

 

C. XXIV.

It is clear
then that
these are

glg‘gggfflgf, aut congruens Dei servis quod Domino placitum
{32th non sit ? Si omnia propter diabolum instituta et

nounced.
ex diaboli rebus instructa monstravimus (nihil enim

non diaboli est, quicquid Dei non est vel Deo dis-
plicet), hoc erit pompa diaboli, adversus quam in
signaculo fidei¹ ejeramus. Quod autem ejeramus,
neque facto neque dicto neque visu neque pro-
spectu participare debemus. Ceterum nonne eJera-
mus et rescindimus signaculum rescindendo testa-
tionem ejus ? Numquid ergo superest, ut ab ipsis
ethnicis responsum flagitemus? Illi nobis jam re-
nuntient, an liceat Christianis spectaculo uti. Atquin
hinc vel maxime² intelligunt factum Christianum de

repudio spectaculorum.

⁹ Taceo de illo... Rig. by con-
ject. reads qui for quam qui, ex-
plaining it by saying that sometimes
when the beasts were let in, one
gladiator to save himself thrust
another forward, who if successful
against the lion sometimes fought
with the first gladiator and was
slain by him, who was thus twice
a murderer. This is approved by
Oehler, but seems to me forced.
The reading of the MSS. quam qui
is adopted by La Cerda, who con-
ceives qui juqulat to be the lion.
But there is little probability in
this. The oppositIon lies between

Itaque negat manifeste,

the gladiator who, as far as in him
lies, causes the death of another by
thrusting him for-ward to the lion,
and him who actually puts him to
death. [f after a gladiator had
fought, the people wiued his death,
another person slew him (juqulabat).
‘ I say nothing of the case of him
who thrust forward a combatant
to the lion to screen himself, lest
he be thought less of a murderer,
than he who afterwards cuts the
same combatant’s throat.’ parum,
quam is equivalent to minus, quam.
See above, c. 16, n. 8.
