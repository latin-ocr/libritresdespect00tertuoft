xxxviii INTRODUGTION.
tullian. The pleasure-seeker had indeed little to urge.
That the indulgence of eye and ear did not interfere
with devotion1 was manifestly contrary to reason and
experience. Nor would the difficulty of obtaining a
livelihood justify unlawful means of subsistence2. The
propriety of avoiding persecution, conciliating favour,
and the like, must evidently depend upon the actions
themselves being indifferent. It is observable that Ter-
tullian meets such pleas by a reference to the baptismal
vow3. He shews the nature of the service into which
the baptized had entered, what they had promised to
give up, and having to his own satisfaction proved that
the things to which he objects were included in the bap-
tismal renunciation, he triumphantly appeals to the duty
of forsaking the world, of suffering or of dying for
Christ's sake.

One plea, however, deserved especial consideration,
and the mode in which it was answered is indicative of
the general views of Tertullian. The world, it was said,
was created by God4. All that was in it was intended
to minister to man’s profit and delight. Why then not
enjoy those objects which are all part of God's creation?
Herein lay the germ of those opinions, which, carried
out into their consequences, resulted in Gnostichsm, and

main argument considered likely to
influence Christians is that of the

baptismal vows,and to the dedication
of the baptized to the service of God,
vcan scarcely escape notice. Besides
the broad distinction between Chris-
tiani and Ethnz’ci, the former being
,admitted to God's household, (De
Spect. 2, familiari flare), we find in
each of these three trea'tises the

baptismal vow. Thus De Spect.
