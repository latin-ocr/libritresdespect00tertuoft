ΟΝ THE TEXT OF TERTULLIAN. xi
of the notes of Pamelius, La Cerda‚ Rigalt, and others,
aecompanies the text. This is a valuable Edition, but it
is by no means accurately printed, and in many cases
the explanatory notes refer to a different reading to that
of the text. The Editors do not seem to have consulted
MSS. themselves, except that they may have seen the
Cod. Agobardi, but nothing like a collation of this MS.
is attempted.

The Edition of Oehler is the most complete which
1 have seen.

Resides the early Editions, Oehler has had the
benefit of

1 Two distinct collations of the Cod. Agobardi, the
former made by Stephen Baluz in the 17th century, the
latter by Hildebrand sor this Edition.

2 The collation of various other MSS. from the
libi-aries of Florence and Vienna. None of these MSS.
contain either the De Spectaculis or De Idololatria.
The most valuable in his estimation is the Cod. May-
liabechianus, of Florence (of the 15th century), which
seems to be of the same family as the Coa. Pithaei15.

3 Emendations and corrections of Josias Mercer
and ,Ioseph Scaliger, noted in the margin cf copies now
preserved at Leyden.

This Edition has an Apparatus Criticus noting the
various readings of the MSS. used, and of the Editions

of a collatiou made for him by the
librarian of the Medicean Library;
and considers it to be the only Flo-
rentine MS. deserving of more ac-

curate inspection than it has hitherto
received.
