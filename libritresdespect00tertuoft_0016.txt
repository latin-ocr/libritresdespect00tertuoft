of Rhenanus, Gangnaeus, Gelenius, Pamelius, and Rigalt,
and in 1115 Apoloyeticus, of the MSS. of Heraldus, and
Muratori. Oehler has in general, but 1101 always, given
the preference to the readings of the Cod. Agobss and
has in some instances inserted in the text emendations
of his own, noting always that he has done so. He
has also selected from the notes of previous Editors,
such as seemed useful‚ adding notes of his own. In
his notes he seems to have made great 1155 of the
Commentary of La Cerda. The third volume contains
dissertations upon Tertullian and his works by various
hands, Pamelius, Allix, Le Nourry, Mosheim‚ Centner,
Noesselt, Semler, and Kayelss.

From what has been said, 11 will be seen that of the
treatises De Spectaculis and De Idololatria, the only MS.
known 10 exist is the Codex Agobardi. The following
111511 are 1115 independent sources from which the read·
ings of these two treatises are derived:

1 Codex Agobardi.

2 Editio Gangnaea, 1115 MS. or MSS. used not being
known.

3 Editio Geleniana‚ the Cod. Masburensis being
used.

4 Editio Pameliana, the Cod. Clementis Angli being
used.

In the De Corona 1115 sources are more numerous :

1 Codex Agobardi.

2 Codex Magliabechianus, 10 which Oehler refers
only in the first six chaptcrs.

3 Codex Vindobonensis.

4 Codex Florentinus.

5 Editio Rhenani, representing the Hirschau MS.

6 Editio Gangnaeana, MS. or MSS. unknown. The
Editio Geleniana probably represents no new MS.

¹⁰ The first Chapter of Kaye’s Tertullian is rendered into Latin by Oehler.
