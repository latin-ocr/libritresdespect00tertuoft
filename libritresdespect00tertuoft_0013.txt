The text has also in many cases (as we learn from
the notes) been altered from mere conjecture.

3 A MS. entitled Codex Pithaei, now Montispessu-
lanus, of the llth century, mutilated. It contains, 1, De
Patientia3 2, De Carnis Resurrectione; 3, Adversus
Praxean3 4, Adversus Valentinianos; 5, Adversus Mar-
cionem3 6, Apologeticus.

4 Besides, he used the MS. Puteanus, and the MS.
Fuhlensis as collated by Junius; and a MS. called Codex
Divionensis, in Rigalt's opinion of no great worth.

The text thus formed by Rigalt has been most widely

accepted. Leprieur in 1661, says of it, ‘Labore inde-
fesso, atque ea sedulitate cum antiquis codd. libros om-
nes contulit, ut nihil addi possit neque post tantam
messem spicilegium ullum faciendum existimemus?
- It may, however, be remarked (1) that Rigalt’s con-
viction of the corrupt state of all MSS. but one, inclined
him to a very free use of corrections upon conjecture.
(2) That of the numerous alterations he has made, he
has seldom mentioned where he has the authority of
MSS. (3) That he has in many cases adopted in the
text readings professedly conjectural; and (4) that his
alterations rest mainly upon two sources, -one the Co-
dex Agobardi, the other supposed MSS. used by Ursinus,
which he describes as Rhenanianis lonye meliores. A
recent examination, however, of the MS. in the Vatican,
made for ,the Editor of the Oxford translation, 1842,
has proved that the notes of Ursinus were merely con-
jectural emendations. See Preface to Oxf. Transl.¹⁸
