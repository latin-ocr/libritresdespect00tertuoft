VALUE 013· TERTULLIAN'S WORKS. xlix

tions of mankind. Ecclesiastical history is concerned
to uncertain the facts and the doctrines of primitive
Christianity; but this is not all. If we would understand
how the kingdom of heaven grew from a little seed to a
mighty tree, and gradually gained an empire over the
hearts of men, we must study the condition of the world
during its growth, and the development of thought in
various directions within the Church itself. The careful
study of an ancient author informs us not only of the
truths held of old, but of the manner in which they were
apprehended. In each of these respects, Tertullian is
most valuable. His vigorous individuality‚ gives us to
see what a primitive Christian was, and how he was
impressed with Christian truths. His varied learning in
subJects whether sacred or profane, renders his works
a rich repository of all that concerns the manners and
customs of his age. Most interesting information is
supplied by him as to ancient rites, and ancient litur-
gical forms; while his very errors render his testimony
to doctrinal truths, of which there was no question, the
more free from suspicion. Above all his intimate ac-
quaintance with and constant reference to the holy
Scriptures, give to his words a peculiar value‚ In him
we have an author who flourished not more than 100
years aster the death of the apostle S. John, bearing testi-
mony direct and incidental to almost every book in the
Scriptural Canon, proving that these Scriptures, and no
others, were regarded in that early age as the voice of
the Holy Spirit ⁴, as the rule of life, of wh0se authority
was no doubt⁵‚ whose decision was without appeal, by
the study of which men were to understand and believess.
