THE DATE OF THE THREE TREATISES. xix

date on all accounts very probable. But it must be
remarked that there may have been many minor distri-
butions of donatives not mentioned by the historian,
any one of which may have been accompanied by the
incident mentioned by Tertullian3 so that the deter-
mination of the year is only conjectural.

If we are to consider that the two former treatises
were written upon some public occasion, we may find
one in the festivities which followed the overthrow of

Albinus in 198⁹. At all events the season of rejoicing, ,

which followed upon the complete establishment of
Severus’ power, would call for such treatises; and we may
therefore conclude, with a great degree of probability,
that these three treatises were all ¹written in the course
of the four years following upon the defeat of Albinus.

It will be observed that Ι have drawn no argument
from the Montanistic views which appear in the several
treatises, excepting so far as affects their relative order.

The truth is that we have no certain means of deter-
mining the year in which Tertullian joined the ranks of
Montanus, and, as Bishop Kaye remarks¹⁰ in answer to
an insinuation of Gibbon, the determination of an early
date to the De Corona would only prove the early date
of Tertullian’s adhesion to Montanism.

There is no evidence as to the place from which any
of these treatises were written. We may however infer
from an expression in the De Spectaculis that it was not
written at Romen, and his strictures upon lax ministers
in the opening chapter make the same probable of the

De C'orona. It is most likely all three were written at
Carthage.
