CHAPTER II.

The State of Heathen Society, and the consequent dzjffi-
culties osa Christian.

To understand the position of a Christian under the
early Emperors, we must glauce at some of the main
features of the life and manners of the heathens at this
time. These were most conspicuous at Rome itself, but
each provincial town followed, though with unequal
steps, the example of the metropolis.

1 The p’ublic amusements occupied an important
place in the life of the community. When the wealth
of conquered cities flowed into Rome, and the arts and
luxuries of foreign nations were transplanted to the
Latin soil, this wealth and these arts were soon employed
to contrive and multiply the public entertainments and
shows. But this natural result of increased power was
extraordinarily promoted under the Empire from other
causes. The policy of Augustus1 to keep the citizens
loyal by supplying them with food and with public en-
tertainments was followed by his successors, many of
whom, like Caligula, Nero, and Domitian, sharing the
popular taste, heightened it by their patronage and
example. Some of the worst of the Emperors were
originally corrupted by these entertainments2, and pa-
tronized them by the most unseemly actions; while the
more sober thought it prudent to indulge the taste of
