tracts were, as a matter of course, materially altered
when the empire became Christian, but we find many
usages retained, which the Christians of an earlier age
thought essentially idolatrous. Such, for instance, was
the use of chaplets. The Apologies of Minucius Felix>
and Tertullian⁷ would convey the impression that the
Christians universally abstained from the use of chaplets‚
and Tertullian speaks of the abstinence as the Christian
rule 8. But his treatise on the subject shews that there
were Christians who demurred to this rule. And when
the more obvious objection (viz, their use in heathen
worship ⁹) was removed, or at least became less prominent
with the decline of Paganism, this scruple was generally
given up, and the poet does not hesitate to call upon
Stilicho to assume the chaplet at the nuptials of his son-
in-law, the Christian Honorius ¹0. And although the use of
chaplets was actually forbidden by a rescript of Arcadius
and Honorius, Prudentius allows the use of flowers to
deck the biers of the deadn. We are more surprised to
observe the change of sentiment that appeared in the
Christian community. Even in the days of Arnobius the
use of temples, altars, incense, flowers, and lights, was
thought absolutely unchristian12. But one by one each of
these was appropriated to the service of God13, until at
last the images of saints took the place of those of false
deities. It is foreign to my purpose to point out the
various stages in this progress, or to shew how idolatrous,
ceremonies were grafted upon Christianity. The asser-
tion of Gibbon, that Christianity mainly owed its growth
to the adoption of pagan rites and superstitious, is con-¹
