&em eibi libet. 1 believe the hypo-
thetic case to include from sim to
moe ,· and the answer to be in lice-
bie. But the direct answer is inter-
rupted by the wieh Utinam quidem ;
the quidem marking as it so often
does that the sentence is introduced
by way of contrast, the main sen-
tence being that which begins with
eod, es in Greek μὲν...δὲ. Tertull.
hu boen saying that ceremonies of
n particular kind may be attended.
But an objection is started, ‘ Sacri-
fico· ere often mixed with them!
Tei-tun. puts a case: ‘ Suppose that
nme been invited,and suppose both
thst the name of my attendance is
not connected with sacrifices, and
that the perron-manee of my part is
apicum-02 Sibi referring to opera
nea .· quantum sibi libet is illustrated
by Oehl. from Adv. Hermog. c. 23:
Funera licet materia quantum sibi
licet vel potius Hermoqeni, and an-
swers very much tc the phrase ad
mmm. Tertull. proceeds to answer
the hypothetical case: ‘Although 1
could wish we were exempt even
from seeing idolatrous sacrificem
yet, sitnated aa we are, it will be
lswful to be present, &c.' He then
proceeds with no doubt to the case
where a person is invited to a sacri-
fice: Plane ad sacerdotium, etc. 11·

we read with mg. Utinam quantum
sibi quidem, nec, we must interpret,
‘Would that it were indeed at its
own pleasure,' i. e. ‘Would that the
performance of the Christian⁷s part
were really so free, as that he were
excused from seeing what he would
not do? For the use of the subj.
sim, see De Spect. c. 6, n. 3. Offi-
cium is especially applied to compli-
mentary attendance upon nuptial
feasts. Sueton. Calig. c. 25: Livi-
am...nubentem‚ cum ad officium et
ι’]ιεε venisset, ad se deduci imperavit.
Claud. c. 262 confecit nuptias, non
repertis qui sequerentur exemplum,
excepto libertino quodam et altero
primipilari, cnjus officium nuptia-
rum et ipse cum Ayrippina celebravit.

tria. Comp. De Spect. c. 8. Malus,
sc. Satanae. Below,c. 21.

Ch. XVII. ¹ liberi. La Cerda‚
Rig. and Oehl. liberti. La C.
remarks that servi corresponds
to dominis, liberti to patronis, offi-
ciales to praesidibus. But Dionys.
Hal. (11. 22) tells us that priests
were assisted by their children, if
they had any, and if not, by children
of other families called camilli. Pro-
bably liberi refers to these.
