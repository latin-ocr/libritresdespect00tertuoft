TERTULLIAN'S SPEGIAL ARGUMENTS. xliii

¹were not the main grounds upon which Tertullian insists.
The promise of the Spirit, given as a teacher of truth,
¹was at all times impressed strongly upon his mind.
Here too, we shall scarcely dissent from the position that
the Holy Spirit has preserved in the Church of Christ a
body of fundamental truths. But in the application of
the rules the difficulty lies. What are universal, what
are fundamental truths? Nor can we disguise from
ourselves that Tertullian's answers to these questions
were often wrong; and it is here that controversialists
of all days have made their departure, often into very
different lines of argument.

But while we admit the general principles laid down
by Tertullian, we must allow that he to a considerable
extent lost sight of the circumstance that the guidance
of the Spirit does not exclude the admixture of error
with truth, whether in the individual or in the Church
visible ; that one consequence of human infirmity is this,
that even in the transmission of truth error will grow up,
‘and that it requires learning, thought, ⁸and patience, to
discover it. The exaggeration‚ I had almost said the
caricature, of the principle that truth is in the Church,
which would make mere lineal succession an adequate
gum-antee for its presence, is the foundation upon which
the errors of the Church of Rome rest. These de-
ductione belonged to a later age than that of Tertul-
‘lian’ffi for , his constant appeals to Scripture as the
supreme authority, shew that if he took the doctrine
-at first hand from authority, he subjected it to the trial
¹of Scripture and of reason, and thence argued back to
