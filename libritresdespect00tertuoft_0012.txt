viii INTRODUchN.

III. Rmufflr is the most distinguished of the Editors
of Tertullian. He published his first Edition at Paris,
1634. The text differs widely from those which preceded
it. The Editor premises that the text of Tertullian as it
stood in all editions and most MSS. extant, had been
miserably corrupted by the alterations of scribes ignorant
of the peculiarities of Tertullian, and that to obtain the
true text recourse must be had to MSS. earlier than these
corrections. He does not set a high value on the MSS.
used either by Rhenanus or Pamelius, but conceives
that his two great aids towards obtaining· a genuine text
were,

1 The emendations which John a Wower tran-
scribed from the handwriting of Fulvius Ursinus, in a
MS. preserved in the Vatican‚ and published in 1603,

under the title of Emendationes Epideicticae, stating that
Ursinus had taken these corrections from MSS.

2 The Codex Ayobardi ¹2. ⁷

Rigalt added notes, chiefly explanatory, mentioning
only in a few cases the alterations he had made in the
text, and the grounds upon which he made them. The
alterations are very numerous. He sums up in an Index
under the name of each Treatise the extent of his alter-
ations. Thus, ‘De Spectaculis. Emendatus octies et cene
ties ex Codicibus Agobardi et Ursini! ‘De Idololatria.
Emendatus centies et trigesies ex Agobardi et Ursini
Codieibus.' ‘De Corona. Emendatus octies et septua-
gies ex Agobardiet Ursini Codicibus?

name, who lived in the time of Char-
