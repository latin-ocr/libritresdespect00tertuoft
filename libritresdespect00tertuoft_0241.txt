‘¹ 1t is difficult to commend too highly this excellent series.''—Guardian.

“The modesty of the general title of this series has, we believe, led many
to misunderstand its character and underrate its value. The books are well
suited for study in the upper forms of our best schools. but not the less are
they adapted to the wants of all Bible students who are not specialists. We
doubt, indeed, whether any of the numerous popular commentaries recently
issued in this country will be found more servieeable for general use.”—

Academy.

“ Of great value. The whole series of comments for schools is highly esteemed
'by students capable of forming a judgment. The books are scholarly without
being pretentious: information is so given as to be easily understood.”—Sword

and Tro-wel.
