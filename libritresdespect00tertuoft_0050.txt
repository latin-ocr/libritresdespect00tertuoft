must examine and determine what is agreeable to God’s
will by the assistance of the Holy Spirit ²⁸. We may in-
deed account for this difference of sentiment by the dif-
ferent position which Tertullian occupied; and this would,
tally with the supposition that he had not long become
a Montanist when he wrote the De Corona. Having
severed himself decidedly from the Church, though he
maintained her doctrines and professed merely to carry
out further her discipline, he found himself at times
in collision with that traditionary custom on which he
once set so high a value. And his increased confidenoe
in special illumination gave a proportionate preponder-
ance to the authority of private judgment. But in truth
Tertullian's habit of pressing his adversary with any
weapon at his command, may induce us to attribute
much of this difference of views to the difference of the
subject which he had in hand ; having in the one case to
support, in the other to attack, a custom prevalent in the
African Church. The argument of the authority of pri-
vate judgment is employed in the De Corona, although
with a very different purpose to that in the De Viryinibus
Velandis. So that perhaps the true conclusion is, that
Tertullian had not very accurately defined the limits of
reason and authority, and appealed in turn to whichever
seemed most on his side, but that as by his secession he
set himself in one way against authority, he became
