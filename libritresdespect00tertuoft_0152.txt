94· TERTULLIANI LIBER

niam ita Malus circumdedit saeculum idololatria⁶,
licebit adesse in quibusdam, quae nos homini, non
idolo, officiosos habent. Plane ad sacerdotium et
sacrificium vocatus non ibo (proprium enim idoli
officium est), sed neque consilio neque sumptu
aliave opera in ejusmodi fungar. Si propter secri-
ficium vocatus assistam, ero particeps idololatriae3
si me alia causa conjungit sacrificanti, ero tantum

spectator sacrificii.

Ceterum quid facient servi vel liberi¹ fideles,

variatione from Gangm look very
much like emendations, to make out
the sense. Others have corrected it
conjecturally: as Ursinus and La
Cerda, Si sim vocatus ,· Latinius and
Junius, Si nec in vocatu. Rigalt,
looking as usual to the Cod. Ag„
adopts its reading, only altering
ad sacrificiis to adsacrificii, which
word he illustrates by admilitia,
from the Pandects. The explana-
tion which Rigalt offers is this:
Tertullian is contemplating the case
of slaves called upon to assist in
such ceremonics. ‘Suppose 1 am
called upon to take part, and the
performance of my duty and service
does not bear the title of assisting
in sacrifice3 let the heathen master
do as much as he pleases, would
only it were as much as he pleased
himself to do, and we might avoid
seeing, &c.’ Oehler adopts Rigalt's
reading, and expresses his general
concurrence in Rigalt's explanation,
illustrating the use of adsacrificii
by adtradux, De Pat. c. 5, and
other instances. So Dodgson trans-
lates it. 1 differ from them, be-
cause, 1 the case of slaves seems to
be first introduced in c. 17, and the
subject here is the general question

of attendance on such ceremonies3
2 the words vocatus and officium
rather imply invitation than com-
mand ; 3 the ellipse supposed before
quantum sibi libet is very harsh.
Oehl. endeavours to Iessea the
harshness, by placing a comma be-
fore et operoe, and interpreting the
sentence, ‘ Suppose that Ihave been
summoned, δῖα, let even the per-
formance of my service be at its
pleasure' (etiam opera mea sibi ex-
pungatur in quantum sibi libet).
As to the reading of the text, Ι ob-
serve, 1 that Si invocatus may very
probably have been a mistake made
by Gangn. in reading his MSS„ ex-
pecting to find si; 2 that ,in eod.
Ag. ad sacrificiis is clearly errone-
ους, and that the MS. is more likely
to be faulty where it disagrees than
where it agrees with others; 3 quae
tum in Gangn. is plainly wrong, and
quantum right3 4 that quantum sibi
in Cod. Ag. in the next sentence is
very probably the repetition of a
copyist from the former sentence.
But if quantum sibi be retained, it
may be explained, as will be shown.
For the explanation :-A11 commen*
tators have supposed the answer
to sim vocatus to lie in quan·
