ΟΝ THE TEXT OF TERTULLIAN. v

had the benefit of a new MS. from Θονκία7 near Milan3
but says that he was chiefly aided acl exactiorem casti-
9att'onem by conjectures founded upon the discovery
of the G'roeciziny style of Tertullian.

In 1545, GANGNAEUS first published at Paris, together
with the works previously known, IX. fresh Treatises of
Tel-tullian, including the De Spectaculis and De Idolo-
latria⁸. What MSS. Gangnaeus used is not known⁹.

GELEMUS in 1550, at Basle, published a complete
Edition of the works of TertulIian, ‘revised’ (he tells us)
‘by reference to several MSS. from various parts of Ger-
many and France,' but especially to the Codex Britanni-
cus, This MS„ which G. calls lonye incorruptissimus, con-
tained only three of the works of Tei-tullian published
by Rhenanus, viz. De Proescriptionibus, De Resurrectione
‚ Carnis, De Monoyamim· but contained also all the treatises
first published by Gangnaeus¹⁰.

There were reprints of this Edition at Basle in 1562,
and at Paris, 1566.

In 1580 an Edition was published at Paris by Barraeus

⁹ From his MSS. or MS. Gang-

noeus supplied lacunae, and cor-
rected many places3 but generally
when au emendation was conjec-
tural was contented to place the
better reading in the margin.

¹⁰ Oehler has no do‘flbt that the
conplures codices were those al-
ready used by Rhenanus: and that
Gelenius had besides these only the
Codex Britannicus, brought to him
by Leland from the Coenobium Mas-
burense. (Masbrough). This MS.

,ιν seems to have contained, 1, De Re-

surrectione Carnis3 2, De Praescrip-

11, De Jejuni03 12, De Oration03
together with the treatise of Nova-
tian, De Trinitate, and a letter of
the same author, De rebus J u-
daicis. Gelenius has not described
the MS„ so that it cannot now
be identified, nor‘ has he told us
where he altered the text from MS„
and where from conjecture. Gele-
nius being given to great freedom
in conjectural emendations, the Ed.
Gangnaea may be considered to re-
present most faithfully the readings
of the class of MSS. used by him
and Gelenius-
