cal testimony of such tradition. Both tradition and law
were enunciations of that which was imperative, not on
account of the law, nor on account of the tradition, but
on account of the principle which was involved therein25.

To discover this principle (ratio), or the reason qs the
thirty, was highly edifying, as confirmatory of saith, but
was not necessary. The law or the tradition must be first
accepted without question, and then might be established
against gainsayers by an examination of the principle.
No doubt this view sets a very high value upon tradition;
but when reason is once set to judge, as Tertullian pro-
poseS, it will not always be content with returning an
answer in support of authority; and Tertullian himself
found this to be the case. Where he is arguing on
the side of universal custom, he insists upon that as
pan-amount, but in laying down his general axioms on
the authority of custom, he seems himself conscious of
the need of some qualification. When he comes for-
ward afterwards to dispute against a custom of the
African Church26, he is not content with a mere
appeal to reason in the ease of a disagreement in cus-
tom, but states some general propositions that are
scarcely consistent with what he had advance'd upon the
former occasion. Truth must never be sacrificed to
eustom. Lapse of time, respect of persons, and the pre-
rogative of localities, often give birth to customs that
militate against truth. Heresy is not convicted by its
novelty, but by its falsehood. The Spirit promised to
the disciples is to stand in the place of custom27. We
