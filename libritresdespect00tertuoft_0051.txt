or rather his individual illumination. But he never lost
sight of the principle, that we, must examine Scripture
for ourselves‚ and confirm our faith in the truths which
we receive, whether of doctrine or observance, by a
comparison of them with Scripture and with reason, a
principle which can alone produce a sound corroboration

bound to obey, and then seek to discover from yourself
or others the reason for your obedience29.

CHAPTER VI.

Tlae value of the Worlcs of Tertullian.

Tan adhesion of Tertullian to Montanism necessarily
threw discredit upon his writings. In the year 492 Pope
Gelasius, who made a very diligent enquiry into canoni-
eal and apocryphal books, classed the works of Tertul-

not merely disowned but utterly cast forth by the whole
Roman Catholic and Apostolic Churchl. Gelasius’ un-
compromising· condemnation had its effect.v All the
early Roman Catholic editors thought it necessary to
apologize for undertaking the works of such an author.

Rhenanus, in his preface, refers to the respect in which
Tel-tullian was held by S. Cyprian and other early
writers, and would qualify the censure* of Gelasius2.
