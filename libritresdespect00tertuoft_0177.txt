ginal mode of celebration was kept
upon the anniversary of the Coena
Domini. Concil. Carthag. 111. c. 29²
ut sacrm altaris non nisi a J‘e-
J‘imis hominibus celebrentur, excepto
uno dio anniversario, quo coena Do-
mini celebratur. See Pole’s Synops.

6-8. The account of the celebra-
tion of the Eucharist in Just. Mar.
apolog. 1. p. 97, shews that it was
then separate from the love-feast.

c. 7. Just. Μ. (l. c.) eays that the
president (ὁ προεστώς) took the
breed and wine, and made thanks-
giving (eiaxapte-riav ἐπὶ πολὺ

person present.

¹¹ Oblationes pro defimctis. The
Eucharistic oblation not for the de-

liveranee from purgator-y, but for
the enlargement of bliss, and for
the mercifnl judgment of those who
resi in the Lord. See the note in
Oxf. Translat. Tertull. de Mono-
gam. c. 10: Enim vero et pro anima
9⁶81 orat, ei resi-iqerium interim ad-
postulat ei, et in prima resurrectione
consortium, et offert annuis diebus
dormiam& eius. Heraldus on Ar-
uob. tv. p. 152, has a long extract
from the Eccles. Hierarch. of the
Pseudo-Dionysius. This work, which
is probably of the 6th century (see
Cave’s Life of Dionysius), shews the
character ot· the funeral services at

Die dominico

that time. The writer enters into
the question of prayers for the dead3
expreesly saying that the prayers are
only for those who have led a holy
life3 that they are offered, because
it is known that God is willing to
perform them3 that they are not
offered for sinners, and if they were,
they would not be granted, agree-
ably to the passage, ‘Ye ask and
obtain not, because ye ask amiss.’
Originally the bread and wine were
an offex-ing of some pious Christiane.
Cypr. De Op. et EL: Locuples et
dives dominicum quum celebrare te
credis, quoe corbanam omnino non
respicis ‚· quoe in dominicum sine sa-
crificio venis ,· quoe partem de sacri-
ficio, quod pauper obtulit, sumis.
Hence the term oblatio was used
for, 1 this offering, 2 the prayer
with which they were presented, 3
the whole celebration of the Lord’s
supper. The Eucharist celebrated
at amarriage was oblatio pro matri-
monio. See Neand. Ch. Hist. Eng.
Tr. 1. p. 457, foll. Her-aldus quotes
Cypr. Ep. 111. 6: Denique et dies
eorum, quibus excedunt, annotate ,-
ut commemorationes eorum inter me.
mov-ias martyrum celebrare possimus.
Quanquam Tertullus...siqm[ficet mihi
dies, quibus in carcere beati fratres
nostri ad immortalitatem qloriosae
mortis exitu trameant, ut celebrentur
hic a nobis oblationes et sacrificia
ob commemorationes eorum. See
