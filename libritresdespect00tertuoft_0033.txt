vmws OF DIFFERENT PARTIES. xxix

you do not make a parade of unnecessary strictness,
whereby you both debar yourselves from much innocent
profit and amusement, and at the same time disparage
and interfere with what we most highly prize.

The offer of this compromise at once brought before
the Christians the question, how far it was lawful to
conform3 and this question was variously answered by
various parties within the Church. The one extreme
was the view of those who glossed over all differences,
took part in the amusements and employments of hea-
then society, and even thought idol—makers fit to be
received into the Church‚ and admitted freely to bear
mle in it. The other, that of those who, deeming the
whole world in the possession of Satan and his angels,
allowed no distinction between what was accidentally
and what was essentially mixed up with idolatry. Gibbon‚
who unhappily never lost an opportunity of throwing
out an insinuation against Christianity‚ has taken ad-
vantage of this variety of opinion, and by bringing
forward, as it suited his purpose, one onother extreme,
and attributing to the whole community the sentiments
of a section, has represented the system of Christianity
now as one of sels-indulgent laxity, and now-as one of
fanatical rigidity. The truth is, that between the two
extremes was wide room for differences of opinion, and
the determination of the golden mean was not arrived at
immediately· or with certainty. The true philosopher
will recognize the vital power os Christianity‚ and trace
its gradual conquest over the world, in obliterating the
worst features of heathen society, sensible all the while

- that the conquest neither was consummated when the

empire became nominally Christian, nor will indeed be
completed until temptation, sin, and error shall be no
more. The repugnance of the public shows to the Chris·
tian principle was early recognized, and expressed in the

form of renunciation required of each Christian at his
Tzur. b
