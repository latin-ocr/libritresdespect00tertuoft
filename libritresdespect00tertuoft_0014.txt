x INTRODUCTION.

Omitting one or two less important Editions‚ we come
to that of Prior-ius (Le Prieur), published at Paris, 1664.
This is the first of an intended series of Latin fathers,
undertaken by a Society ; but is the only volume which
appeared. It was for some time considered as the Editio
Optima, containing all Rigalt’s notes, with selectione of
those of Rhenanus, Pamelius, La Cerda, and others,
with some notes by the Editor.

Le Prieur adheres to the text of Rigalt.

The Editions of Rigalt and of Priorius were repub-
lished at various times and places,

These have been the sources from which Subsequent
Editions have in general been derived.

Of modern Editions we may notice that commenced
by Semler at Halle, in 1769, and completed by Schutz.
Semler in general restored the text of the first edition
of Rhenanus, but also altered much from conjecture.
Schutz followed the same plan, adopting the readings of
Rhenanus and Pamelius, except where they were alto-
gether intolerable14.

More important is the Edition published at the
Migne Press at Paris, in 1844. The Editors profess
to adopt as their basis the text of Le Prieur, that is of
Rigalt, but at least as frequently they adopt the more
ancient reading. They note the variet-ies of reading of
various Editions in many instances; but this is very im-
perfectly done, and there are many errors. A selection

on De Cor. c. 5: ‘Quem (sc. eod.
Agob.) innumeris lacunis et mendis
per librarii incuriam natis foedatum

did not sufficiently appreciate the
distinct character of the MS. Ful-
densis, and accordingly made cor-

rections of particular words from
that MS„ mixing vthem up with
readings of MSS. of an altogether
different family. He also eonfirms
the statement that the alteration
of Ursinus, edited by John a WVou-
wer, were purely conjectural. Oeh-
ler, who is certainly not inclined to
depreciate the Cod. Agob„ remarks

esse ex hoc de Corona libro et reli·
quis facile aliquis demonstraret!
