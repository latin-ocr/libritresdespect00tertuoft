THE VIEWS OF TERTULLIAN. xxxv

deep philosopher, an expert logician, a practised rheto-
rician, and a learned antiquarian⁵. Zealous, sels-devoted,
and thoroughly sincere, he was one who was seduced
into error by his very desire to do and suffer for the
truth,—no unapt representation of the stern old Roman
character, which counted no toil severe enough, no
obstacle great enough, to interrupt the straight course
to national power and individual renown, only that Ter-
tullian substituted for the love of country a love of
Christ, and for the empty vision of undying fame, the
more fair and more certain prospect of eternal happiness
in heaven.

We shall find no difficulty in discovering the points in
Tertullian's character that unhappily inclined him towards
the errors of Montanus. Not to enter into details upon
the subject of Montanism, it will be sufficient to remark,

,that the feature of that system which proved attractive to

so many, was its profession of a more perfect rule than

⁴ that of the Gospel, more elevated in knowledge, and more

austere in practice; this rule being established by direct
communication of the Paraclete to inan, especially to
Montanus and his associates. This principle was in fact
the exaggeration of the truth that Christianity must be
interpreted not by the letter but by the spirit, and that
the assistance of the Holy Ghost was given to the people
of God. The exaggeration resulted in fanaticism and im-
postureybut Tertullian was not the man to weigh evi-
dence very scrupulously, or to start back from apparent
improbabilities ; and the highflown pretensions of the
Montanists suited his vehemence‚ always striving to soar
above the world and all that was in the world. As long

locum Tertullianus omnium disci· ricis exercitatissimus, in omni anti-
plinarum exacte peritus, et in arca- quitatis et gentilium litterarum cog-
nis litteris nulli secundus. Philo· nitione consummatissimus, quam ei
sophiam calluit egregie, disputandi laudem Eusebii Ecclesiastica histo-
rationem summe tenuit, in rheto- ria tribuit! Rasum. Pam.
