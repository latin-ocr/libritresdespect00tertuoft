Cn.XI. ¹aqonum. Tert.briefly
considers aqones under the heads
of oriqo, tituli, apparatus, loeus,
artes. Aqones were properly in
Greece what ludi were in Rome,
and they had a common origin.
But although Tarquinius Priscus
is said to have introduced puqilee
in the Circus, the only Gamea which
became truly national at Rome were

the abanet-taces. C. Fulvius first ³

introduced athletas after the AEto-
lian war 186 Bc. ; and in later days'
Greek Games became fashionable
under the name of Aqones. Scorp.

Circus Aqonalis at Rome, and Par-
vinius engraves a coin representing
Aurelian sacrificing at the metoe,
inscribed Aqonalia Auq. Aureliani
Auqusti.
