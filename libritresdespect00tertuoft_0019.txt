ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ΤΕΧΤ OF· TERTULLIAN'. xv

this 3 and though some of my notes may seem unneces-
sary to the more practised scholar, I trust that they will
not be useless to those for whom they were intended.
There is no lack of material ready at hand to the
commentator upon Tertullian. The notes of Rhenanus,
Pamelius, Rigalt, not to mention more modern anno-
tators, supply all or nearly all that is wanting. But the
most copious commentaries are those of La Cerda. Ι
have consulted the best of those commentators, and
especially have examined throughout the paraphrase and
notes of La Cerda, who brought in information of all

. kinds from the earlier commentators as well as from his

own knowledge. The notes of Oehler have also been
very servieeable to me, although great part of these are
derived from earlier editors, and especially from Rigalt,
one of the most acute and sagacious of Commentators.
Besides this, I have made use of the late Bishop Kaye's
Accownt of the Writinys os Tertullian, and of Neander‘s
Antiymsticus (of which there is an English translation in
a volume of Bohn’s Library)‚ and of the translation of
Mr Dodgson, published in the Oxford Library of the
Fathers.

The ancient editions which I have had· in hand are
these:

1 The first edition of Rhenanus, 1521, belonging to

Cambridge University Library.

That of Gelenius, 1566, in the British Museum.
That of De la Bane, 1582. -
That of Pamelius, 1617.
That of La Cerda, 1624—30.
That of Rigalt, 1641.
That of Le Prieur, 1664.
The five last are in Sion College Library.
