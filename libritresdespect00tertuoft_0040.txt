xxxvi INTRODUGTION.

as he could take these flights within the Church, he
was content, and he valued highly the dogmatic tmths
therein taught; but when his enthusiasm was looked
upon coldly, ancl was cheeked by persons in high sta-
tion, his impetuosity could not brook the opposition.
In the Roman Church, there was from the first a leaning
towards moderation in regard to discipliness, which to Ter-
tullian must have seemed culpable laxity, and this may
not improbably have brought him into collision with the
presbyters of Rome, to whose arrogant treatment of
him Jerome ascribed his secession7, much as in modern
days Whitfield and Wesley were said to have been driven
from the Church by the perseeution of its rulers, because
these rulers felt the necessity of interfering to check and
moderate the excesses of their enthusiasm. We may
therefore expect to meet with many points of resem-
blance in the opinions maintained by Tertullian in his
Montanistic and his non-Montanistic Treatises. In some
we shall find positive assertion of the tenets of the new
sect, and positive attacks upon the members of the
Church⁸. But where these are wanting, we discover the
same method of argument, references to the same Scrip-
tural passages in the same sense, and a prominency given
to tho'se topics which were the favourite topics of Mon·
tanism, The mere mention of the New Jerusalem,
Revelations‚ the Universal Priesthood, and the like, are
not enough to determine that Tertullian was a Montanist
when he made them 9. If we could arrange with certainty
his treatises in chronological order, and know positively
the date of his secession, we might trace throughout
the gradual development of his particular views in one
direction, in the course of which he for some time
imagined himself to be only maintaining the Church-sys-
