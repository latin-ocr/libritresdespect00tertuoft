 

οΝ THE TEXT or TERTULUAN. xiii

7 Editio Pameliana, in which three vatican MSS.
were used. ,

Finding that the notice of various readings was very
imperfect in the editions of Tertullian, I had, previously
to the appearance of Oehler’s e‘dition, collated the edi-
tions of Gelenius, of Pamelius, and of Rigalt, as the re-
presentatives of the three sources of the text of the De
Spectaculis and De Idololatria. Ι had not been able to
procure the edition of Gangnaeus, nor had I the oppor-
tunity of consulting any MS. The appearance of the
edition of·0ehler‚ in which so much more was done in
respect to the text than I could even attempt, rendered
it quite unnecessary for me to complete my compara-
tively insignificant collation. And I have therefore made
use of Oehler’s Apparatus Griticus in order to determine
the text which Ι should adopt, only noting such varieties
of reading as seem materially to affect the interpreta-
tion of any passage. Those who wish for more particu-
lar information in this respect will find it in Oehler’s
edition. x

The text which Ι have adopted does not precisely
agree with that of any edition that has hitherto appeared.
The imperfect-ioris of the Cod. Agobardi, which Oehler
himself allows and notices‚ have led me to consider that
somewhat too high a value has been set upon it. Where
the other ancient sources agree, I have in general adopt-
ed the reading derived from them, although ‘it is true

’ that in the first two treatises here published‚ the sources

are so few, that it may be fairly thought by many that
one actual MS. (and that ancient and good) should out-
weigh the authority of two or three whose readings are
only known through early printed editions. But agree-
ment even of only two or three MSS„ if these are inde-
pendent, as in this ease there seems reason to suppose,
has had with me the preponderance.
