many being little aware that the promise to renounce
the pompe of this world was first imposed on account of
the public spectacles of Rome, and was connected with
that discipline which refused to admit into the Church
any person immediately engaged in the performance or
administration of those heathen showsl. It is the glory
of the Christian writers that they with one voice cried
aloud against the inhumanity and the vanity of the
popular amusements of the day 2. And their voice was
partially heard. The gladiatorial combats, the most plainly
abominable‚ were forbidden by the first Christian emperor,
but they were not at once discontinued. Gladiators
were exhibited under Constantine, Valentinian, and even
Theodosius. And the Christian poet Prudentius felt the
necessity of making an appeal on this subject to the
emperor Honorius, an appeal which was answered by
their final suppression. In the other amusements the

in the Rescript referred to in the
next page, evidently wished to re-
establish Paganism by introducing
into it the puter morals of Christi-

anity. At the close he recommends
to the priests the care of the poor,
which, he says, the Galilaeans, find-

to draw in followers to their sect.
