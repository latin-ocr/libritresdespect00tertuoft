 

THE STATE OF HEATHEN SOCIETY. xxi

the populace; as the wisc Theodoric deemed it not un-
worthy amid his graver cares to take thought for the
amusements of the peop1e³.

The three sources of public amusement were the
chariot-races in the circus3 the gladiatorial shows and
combats with wild beasts in the amphitheatre3 and the
exhibitions of the theatre.

The passion for the chariot-race had taken early
hold of the Roman people. Ennius describes vividly the
excitement caused by a chariot-race in his day (13.0. 170),
and Ovid has more than one description to the same
effeet⁴. The madness of the circus had soon become
proverbial, but the height to which this madness mounted
under the emperors is almost inconceivable. Caligula,
when the populace were clamouring against his favourite
eharioteer, wished that they had one neck, that he
might destroy them all together5, and upon one occasion
let loose a body of soldiers to massacre a crowd that
shewed a similar opposition to his wishesss. The quar-
tels between two factions espousing different colours led
to frequent bloodshed. The imprisonment of a favourite
charioteer was the occasion of an insurrection at Thessa-
loniea'1, and the murder of its governor, an act which
was subsequently revenged by a massacre of the people
at a chariot-race. And the rescripts of Theodoric in-

’ form us that senators of Rome made no seruple of
sending in 'armed retainers to deal out death to the
populace when their favourite charioteers were assailed
with taunts or ridicule ⁸.
