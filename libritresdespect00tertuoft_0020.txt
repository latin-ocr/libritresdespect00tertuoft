THE PURPOSE OF THE THREE TREATISES, ΟΝ
SHOWS, ΟΝ IDOLATRY, AND ΟΝ THE OROWN.

CHAPTER Ι.
On the Date of the composition of the three treatises.

HE date of the composition of these three treatises

can be settled only by internal evidence. It has been
generally assumed by those who have discussed this
question, that the De Spectaculis was written upon occa·
sion of some general exhibition of public shows, which
brought the question of their lawfulness prominently
into notice. Although this is far from improbable, the
language of the treatise does not make it necessary.
The supposed allusionl is sar too vague to justify any
decided inference from it. The subject of the shows
and of idolatry must have been constantly before the
mind of the Christian, so that it would require no
special occasion to account for the appearance of such
v treatises. At the same time, if upon other grounds we
conclude that these books were written within a period
in which any such general exhibition took place, it will
not be unreasonable to suppose that this circumstance
may have been the immediate cause of their appearance.

The striking similarity of expression and mode of
thought observable in these three treatises, incline us
to assign to them dates not widely distant from each
other, while the distinct mention of the De Spectaculis
in the De Idololatria (c. 13), and the (at least) implied
reference to it in the De Corona (c. 6), determines the
priority of order to the De Spectaculis, The De Idolola-

¹ De Spectac. c. 6: De natalibus et solemnitatibus requm, et publicis
prosperitatibus.
