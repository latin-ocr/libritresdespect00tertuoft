xxii INTRODUCTION.

The taste for gladiatorial shows was not less national
with the Romans. This cruel diversion, which had ori·
ginated in the rude age of war and blood, lost none of
its attractions in the days of spurious civilization and
polished barbarism. Julius Caesar, when aedile, exhibited
310 pair of gladiators. Titus gave shows lasting 100
days; Trajan, shows of 123 days, in which were engaged
1Ο,ΟΟΟ gladiatores. Nor were these shows, any more than
the chariot-race, confined to the capital. Each provincial
town had its circus and its amphitheatre. In every town
of the least importance the arena was stained with the
blood of men slain either in combat with their fellows‚
or in contests with wild beasts. It is computed by Lip-
sius that in the times of Trajan no less than 20,000 or
30,000 gladiators fell in each month throughout the
year. Atque haec delicias vocabant et cibum oculorum!

The theatre at Rome had at all times differed widely
from that of Greece. Tragedy was but a tame copy of
a Greek original, wanting most of its worthiest elementa:
comedy, even in the hands of Terence, had aimed at
little more than representing in a native dress the pro-
ductions of Athenian masters. The Romans of the Em-

pire did indeed delight in the theatres‚ but not to enjoy .

The very name of actor (histrio) was synonymous with
that of pantomimist (mimus). These pantomimes re-
sembled in some respects the modern ballet. Some
story was told by action accompanied by music, but
unaccompanied by words; musica muta, as Cassiodorus
calls it10. The pantomimists had great art in repre-
