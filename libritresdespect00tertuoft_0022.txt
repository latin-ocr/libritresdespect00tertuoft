'xviii IN TR ODUOTION.

pacem would refer it to the interval of comparative
repose which the Christians enjoyed between the per-
secution of Antoninus in 167 and that of Severus in
202. Some have supposed that the persecution, although
begun, had not reached the East where the incident
mentioned in the De Corona took place; but it is im-
probable that Tertullian would not have known of the
edict of 202, or that he would have written as he did
without referring to it. We may also remark, that al-
though the treatise tells of the punishment of the soldier
as being a Christian, it does not imply that there was
then any violent persecution raging. At all times under
heathen emperors the open profession of Christianity
would have met with punishment, especially in the case of
a soldier acting against common discipline. And Tertul-
lian’s hesitating admission of the possibility of a Christian
remaining in the army without blame⁵ would not have
been made in times of a public persecution. This then
seems to determine the date of the De Corona as not
later than 202.

3 Having thus brought ourselves within four years,
we examine the history of the times, and find records
within these years of three acts of imperial liberality:
(1) in 198, to the people when Severus set out for the
East⁶; (2) to the soldiers, in honour of giving to Cara-
calla the title of Augustus, and to Geta that of Caesar⁷;
(3) in 202, when Severus and Caracalla were meditating
an expedition into Egyptss. Of these three the second
most accords with the case of Tertullian, the first being
rather a largess to the people, the third an increase of
pay. If then we must select one of these three occa-
sions, we bring the date of the De Corona to 201, a
