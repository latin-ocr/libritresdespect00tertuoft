TERTULLIAN'S SPECIAL ARGUMENTS. xxxix

which were so vehemently opposed by Ter-tullian. The
danger lay in obliterating the distinetiveness of Christi-

Tertullian’s reply was both philosophical and just. True,
that the works of creation were good. True, that man
was created in the image of God, but his nature was
corrupted at the fall, and so he substituted for the natu-
