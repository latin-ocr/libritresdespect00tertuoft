est. Inde et ipsi sacri vel funebres instituti aut
diis nationum aut mortuis fiunt. Proinde tituli,
,Olympia J ovi, quae sunt Romae Capitolina, item
Herculi Nemeaea, Neptuno Isthmia, ceteri mor-
tuarii agones. Quid ergo mirum, si apparatus
agonum idololatria conspurcat de coronis profanis,
de sacerdotalibus praesidibus, de collegiariis minis-
tris²‚ de ipso postremo boum sanguine? Ut de
loco suppleam, ut de loco communi³ pro collegio
artium Musicarum et Minervalium et Apollinarium,
etiam Martialium, per duellum ⁴, per tubam in

⁹ de colleqiariis ministris, ser-
vants of the various religious cor-

dium, which is even of itself, with-
out such adjuncts, a temple of the

pontione—of Augures, of Pontifices,
of Quindecimviri, and the like. All
the adjuncts here mentioned had
place in the Circus as well as the
studium.

⁸ ut de loco communi. Cod. Ag.
and Gangn. at de loco. Gel. and
Pam. ut. Rig. ac. Jun. and Oehl. et.
The latter especially warns the
render against connecting et de loco
munt· with suppleam. He refers
it to the following clause, and con-
’siders the words in circo (probably
a misprint for in etadio) as used by
“ 'way of exegesis. The repetition
of de 1000 seems to carry us back
rather than foi-ward, and as et and
ac are both conjectural, and at is
inadmissible, 1 have retained ut.
‘To add a word in regard to a
“lomuty forming a kind of common
ground for the arts of the Muses, of
Minerva, of Apollo, and also of

idol whose solemnities it celebrates?

⁴ per duellum. The Cod. Ag.
omits these words. Dodgs. eon-
nects them with Martialium bnt
the battle and trumpets were both
principal features in which the sta-
dium resembled the Circus.

⁵ in stadio. Oehler reads in
stadio. Cod. A‘g. collated by
Baluz, stadio5 mos recently by
Hildebrand in statio. Ganga. aut
stadio. Gel. and Pamel. ut stadio,
who also read aemulentur. The Ludi
Martiales and Apollinares were usu-
ally celebrated in the Circus Maxi-
mus, but on extraordinary occasions
a stadium was prepared elsewhere
as for the athletic contests exhibited
by Julius Caesar. Sueton. J ul. c. 39.
Cicero in his classification of public
games does not mention the stadium,
but assigns athletic exercises to the
Circus. De Leg. 11. 15: Jam ludi
