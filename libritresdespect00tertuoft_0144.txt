this: In observing these days, you
are either not known, or you are
known to be a. Christian. If you

tian! The heathen‚ though they
know you to be a Christian, will wink

act as a virtual abnegation of your
faith. Tei-tullian then goes on to
state the consequence which follows
on either alternative: ‘You have
