xlviii ΙΝ TRODUGTION. ⁷

To prevent error, he adds Dqfinitiones ecclesiastieorum
doymatum. Pamelius prefixes a list of Paradoxes of
Tertullian‚ with the Antidotes of Pamelius. And Rigalt,
in his preface, endeavours to shew that the Montanism
of Tertullian was of a very moderate tone, and expresses
his unwillingness to sanction any heterodox opinions in
terms which have been thought rather politic than
sincere ³.

I have not attempted to define very accurately Ter-
tullian’s opinions, or to distinguish what are and what
are not Montanistic. The value of his writings consiste
not so much in his special opinions, as in the light which
his works throw upon the history of the early Church.
His acknowledged unsoundness in some particulars will
of itself warn us to use a caution which is scarcely less
necessary in the study of writers more strictly orthodox.
For we should in all cases consider the position of the
Fathers as witnesses and as men. Both their testimony
and their opinions are affected by the age in which they
lived. The value of the former is manifestly enhanced
by proximity to apostolic times. Their opinions derive
some weight from the same cause. But in judging of

them we must make the proper allowances for the Δ

character of the individual and of his age. Disregard
to this consideration has led some to estimate the Fathers
by modern notions and modern habits of thought, and to
ridicule the outward peculiarities of those whose in-
trinsic excellence they do not understand. It has led
others to attach to their writings an authority which
they themselves never dreamt of claiming, and to view
their works as a series of separate maxims and propo-
sitions to be collected into a code, all but infallible, and
apphcable, without modification, throughout all genera-

the decree, however, quoted in the ⁸ Dupin and other Romanist
former note do not admit ‘of this editors complain of the looseness of
*mild interpretation. Rigalt’s opinions on many points.
